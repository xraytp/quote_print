The purpose of the program Quote Print is to print to stdout a quote appended by
its respective author from an external file of quotes. The quote is chosen
randomly.

The program imports the file of quotes from a filepath given by the commandline
at execution. The quotes are paired with their author into a linked list. The 
quote is chosen at random where the seed of randomness is given by the current 
time.

The format of the quote file is an ASCII file where the quote ends with a
newline, followed by the author, followed by a newline.

After the quote has been randomly selected it is printed with a colour to the
standard output along with its author in a different colour. The quote and
author must not extend past 80 characters per line. Newlines will substitute
the last whitespace before a line extends past 80 characters. 

After the quote is printed the purpose of the program is fulfilled and the 
program ends.


Program was completed on the 11th of December, 2020 according to above.
Version is dubbed "1.0".

When program is executed multiple times within the same second the exact same
quote is selected. To remedy this randomness will be instead seeded from
/dev/urandom rather than the time.
